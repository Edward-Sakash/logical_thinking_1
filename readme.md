    Look at two laws of Boolean algebra (DeMorgan's Laws)
    
    "$ \\neg (P\\lor Q)\\iff (\\neg P)\\land (\\neg Q) 
    
    "$ \\neg (P\\land Q)\\iff (\\neg P)\\lor (\\neg Q) 
    
    "- $ \\neg $ is the negation logic operator (NOT)
    "- $ \\land $ is the conjunction logic operator (AND)
    "- $ \\lor $ is the disjunction logic operator (OR)
